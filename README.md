**The AI engineering workflow framework for teams.**

Jig is a full-lifecycle development framework that guides AI agents through a structured pipeline — from ticket to post-mortem. Named after the manufacturing tool that holds workpieces and guides tools to produce consistent results, Jig aligns your entire team around shared conventions, quality gates, and development workflows.

## Why Jig?

Without a framework, teams end up with scattered AI skills, inconsistent workflows, and no shared conventions. Some engineers brainstorm before coding; others don't. Code review quality varies. Nobody's sure which skills exist or when to use them.

Jig fixes this the way Rails fixed web development: with strong opinions, sensible defaults, and a clear structure that everyone follows.

## What You Get

**Full Pipeline** — Every stage of development has a skill:
```
DISCOVER → BRAINSTORM → PLAN → EXECUTE → REVIEW → SHIP → LEARN
```

**Parallel Execution** — `/jig-team-dev` spawns parallel agent teammates with staggered quality gates. Your implementation plan runs in parallel, with spec compliance and code review at every step.

**Review Swarm** — `/jig-review` dispatches specialist reviewers in parallel (security, dead code, error handling, async safety, performance). Teams add their own domain-specific specialists.

**Configurable, Not Rigid** — `jig.config.md` lets you tune the pipeline per work type, define your concerns checklist, choose your ticket system, and set review policies. Override only what you need.

**Extensible** — Add domain skills (`be-database`, `fe-react`), custom specialists (`typeorm.md`, `i18n.md`), and team agents. They wire into the framework's discovery system automatically.

## Quick Start

### Option A: Add to your project settings (recommended)

Add this to your project's `.claude/settings.json` — every teammate gets Jig automatically on clone:

```json
{
  "enabledPlugins": {
    "jig@duronext-jig": true
  },
  "extraKnownMarketplaces": {
    "duronext-jig": {
      "source": {
        "source": "github",
        "repo": "duronext/jig"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Commit that file. Done. The entire team gets 15 pipeline skills, 3 agents, 5 review specialists, and an engineering starter pack — zero manual setup.

### Option B: Install via CLI

If you prefer the interactive approach:

```bash
# Add the Jig marketplace (one-time per user)
/plugin marketplace add duronext/jig

# Install for your whole team
/plugin install jig@duronext-jig --scope project
```

### First Use

```bash
/jig-kickoff    # Start working on a task — guides you through the full pipeline
/jig-brainstorm # Design a feature before building it
/jig-extend     # Add your first team skill
```

Type `/jig-` to see all available commands. See [docs/init-experience.md](docs/init-experience.md) for the interactive setup flow that generates your `jig.config.md`.

### Other Platforms (Gemini, Codex)

Clone the repo and reference the skills directly:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/duronext/jig.git .jig
```

See [adapters/](adapters/) for platform-specific integration guides.

## How It Works

Jig ships as a plugin with 15 core skills, 3 agents, and 5 review specialists. Your team adds domain skills in `.claude/skills/` that wire into the framework automatically.

### Core Skills (the pipeline)

| Command | Skill | What It Does |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| `kickoff` | Pipeline orchestrator | Classifies work (bug/feature/improvement/task) and routes through the appropriate pipeline stages. The entry point for all development work. |
| `brainstorm` | Design exploration | One question at a time, 2-3 approaches with trade-offs, design approval gate. Surfaces your team's concerns checklist from `jig.config.md`. |
| `prd` | Requirements capture | Structured PRD with enforceable acceptance checklists. Two tiers: Full (12 sections) for features, Light (5 sections) for bugs. Layer-tagged items (`[API]`, `[DATA]`, `[LOGIC]`, `[UI]`) feed directly into spec reviewers. |
| `plan` | Implementation planning | Turns approved designs into bite-sized TDD tasks with exact file paths, code snippets, and verification steps. Output is executable by `team-dev` or `sdd`. |
| `team-dev` | Parallel execution | Spawns agent teammates in split panes. Each implementer works independently; the lead orchestrates staggered spec compliance + code quality reviews as they finish. The killer feature that makes it all worth it! |
| `sdd` | Serial execution | Fresh subagent per task with two-stage review (spec compliance then code quality). For tightly coupled tasks or when agent teams aren't available. |
| `review` | Code review swarm | Dispatches parallel specialist reviewers (security, dead code, error handling, async safety, performance + your team's specialists). Filters by glob match, scores mechanically, produces unified report. |
| `pr-create` | PR creation | Runs the review swarm first, then analyzes all commits, groups by theme, writes a clear description with test plan. No corporate speak. |
| `pr-respond` | PR feedback | Fetches unresolved comments, analyzes each (valid fix vs false positive), implements fixes, commits, pushes, replies, and resolves threads. The full loop. |
| `postmortem` | Retrospective | After merge, analyzes what reviewers caught to find gaps in skills and specialists. Diagnoses whether the swarm or logic reviewer should have caught it, then fixes the gap. |
| `debug` | Systematic debugging | Iron law: no fixes without root cause investigation. Four phases — investigate, analyze patterns, test hypothesis, implement. Escalates to "question the architecture" after 3 failed fixes. |
| `verify` | Verification gate | Evidence before assertions. Run the command, read the output, THEN claim it works. Prevents "should pass now" claims without proof. |
| `tdd` | Test-driven development | Red-green-refactor. No production code without a failing test first. Wrote code before the test? Delete it. Start over. |
| `finish` | Branch completion | Verifies tests pass, then presents 4 options: merge locally, create PR, keep branch as-is, or discard. Handles worktree cleanup. |
| `extend` | Framework extension | The meta-skill. Interviews you about what you need, determines the right artifact (skill, specialist, agent, pack, or config change), scaffolds it with valid frontmatter, and wires it into discovery. |

### Core Agents

| Agent | Trigger | What It Does |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| `commit` | "commit the work" | Conventional commits with hook awareness. Reads commitlint config, respects existing hooks, stages specific files. |
| `code-review` | "review my code" | Dispatches the full review swarm (`tier: all`) and delivers the confidence-scored report. |
| `pr-review` | "post review comments" | Posts inline PR comments with suggestion blocks. Validates every path and line number against the diff before posting. |

### Core Specialists

Dispatched by `/review` as parallel subagents. Language-agnostic:

| Specialist | Severity | What It Catches |
|-----------|----------|----------------|
| `security` | blocking | Injection, hardcoded secrets, auth gaps, data exposure |
| `dead-code` | major | Unused exports, write-only variables, disconnected wiring, unreachable branches |
| `error-handling` | major | Swallowed errors, missing handling, inconsistent patterns, context loss |
| `async-safety` | major | Race conditions, premature state flags, resource leaks, error path divergence |
| `performance` | minor | N+1 patterns, unbounded operations, unnecessary computation, over-fetching |

Teams add their own specialists in `.claude/specialists/` (e.g., `typeorm.md`, `i18n.md`, `graphql-contracts.md`). The swarm discovers them automatically.

### Engineering Starter Pack

Ships with Jig. Three skills + one specialist for universal engineering practices:

| Skill/Specialist | What It Does |
|-----------------|-------------|
| `eng-copywriting` | Sentence case for all user-facing text. Always loaded. |
| `eng-logging` | When to error vs warn vs info vs debug. Structured logging. |
| `eng-testing` | Test pyramid, arrange-act-assert, mocking strategy, flaky test policy. |
| `test-coverage` (specialist) | Reviews changed code for missing test coverage during swarm review. |

### Your Team Skills

Your domain expertise lives in `.claude/skills/` in your project. These follow Jig's schema and wire into the framework:

- **Glob-triggered**: edit a database entity file → `be-database` skill auto-loads
- **Concerns checklist**: listed in `jig.config.md` → surfaces during `/jig-brainstorm`
- **Review swarm**: team specialists in `.claude/specialists/` → dispatched by `/jig-review`
- **Created with**: `/jig-extend` scaffolds new skills with valid frontmatter

### Configuration

`jig.config.md` in your project root controls the pipeline:

```yaml
## Team
name: Acme
platform: claude
git-host: github
ticket-system: linear
ticket-prefix: ENG

## Concerns Checklist
- i18n: .claude/skills/fe-i18n
- security: core/specialists/security
- test-strategy: manual
```

The concerns checklist surfaces during brainstorming — mapping your team's engineering concerns to specific skills. See [framework/CONCERNS_CHECKLIST.md](framework/CONCERNS_CHECKLIST.md).

### Tier System

| Tier | Activation | Use For |
|------|-----------|---------|
| Standards | Always loaded | Universal rules (copywriting, commit format) |
| Domain | Glob-triggered | Stack expertise (database, frontend, testing) |
| Feature | Narrow globs | Feature-specific knowledge |
| Workflow | Explicit invocation | Pipeline skills (`kickoff`, `review`) |

## Updating

Jig is distributed as a Claude Code plugin. To get the latest version:

```bash
/plugin marketplace update duronext-jig
/plugin install jig@duronext-jig --scope project
```

## Platform Support

Jig skills are platform-agnostic markdown. Adapters handle loading for:
- **Claude Code** (primary) — native plugin integration
- **Gemini CLI** — GEMINI.md context loading
- **Codex** — AGENTS.md integration

Teams using GitLab or Bitbucket are supported via the [git host adapter](framework/GIT_HOST.md).

## Origin

Jig was extracted from [Duro's](https://www.durolabs.co) new platform, where 31 battle-tested skills, 6 agents, and 10 specialist reviewers evolved into a comprehensive AI-assisted development system. Born from a hardware startup that knows what jigs do.
