# CasaFlow (built on Jig)

CasaFlow is the CasaPerks AI engineering workflow — spec-first,
comprehension-gated, and Jira-native. It is built on the Jig framework and
customized for CasaPerks engineering culture.

**Four priorities**: Speed · Dev comprehension · Code robustness · Developer
education

CasaPerks overrides live in `team/`. The Jig core is untouched in `core/`.
This repo uses itself to develop itself (Consumer Zero).

## Core Philosophy

1. **Convention over configuration.** Jig has opinions. Teams override what they need; everything else just works.
2. **The framework is the nervous system, team skills are organs.** Jig discovers, loads, and orchestrates team-created skills. They're part of the system, not separate from it.
3. **Full lifecycle.** Ticket to post-mortem. Every stage has a skill, every handoff has a quality gate.
4. **Language-agnostic core.** The pipeline works for any stack. Stack-specific expertise comes from team skills and starter packs.

## Architecture

Jig has three discovery layers, in priority order:

```
1. team/           <- Highest priority (team overrides)
2. packs/          <- Pack defaults (starter kits)
3. core/           <- Framework defaults
```

If a team skill has the same name as a core skill, the team version wins. This is how teams customize without editing framework files.

### The Pipeline

Every development task flows through stages. `kickoff` orchestrates the full pipeline:

```
DISCOVER → BRAINSTORM → PLAN → EXECUTE → REVIEW → SHIP → LEARN
```

Work type (bug/feature/improvement/task) determines which stages run and at what depth. Configured in `casaflow.config.md` (or `jig.config.md`).

### How Skills Compose

- **Direct invocation** — workflow skills invoke each other by name (`kickoff` → `brainstorm` → `plan`)
- **Concerns checklist** — `jig.config.md` maps engineering concerns to skills. `brainstorm` reads the config and loads relevant skills during design.
- **Specialist dispatch** — `review` discovers specialist `.md` files from all three directories, filters by glob match, and dispatches as parallel subagents.

## Inventory

### CasaFlow Team Skills (6) — `team/skills/`

These override or extend the Jig core for CasaPerks.

| Skill | Overrides | Purpose |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| `kickoff` | `core/skills/kickoff` | Adds spec-first gate for features/improvements |
| `spec` | *(new)* | Guides developer through writing a feature spec before code |
| `approve-gate` | *(new)* | Stage report + 3 comprehension questions after each build stage |
| `explain` | *(new)* | 5-section education explanation: approach, failure modes, change surface, tests, refactor |
| `review-tests` | *(new)* | 4-phase test audit: coverage, mutation testing, rubric, letter grade |
| `retro` | *(new)* | Post-feature retrospective with pattern detection across retros |

### Jira Pack — `packs/jira/`

| Skill | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `jira-sync` | 7-step spec-to-Jira sync; stage status updates; PR URL comments |

### Core Skills (16)

| Skill | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `kickoff` | Pipeline orchestrator — classifies work, routes through stages |
| `brainstorm` | Collaborative design exploration with configurable concerns checklist |
| `prd` | PRD creation with enforceable acceptance checklists (feeds into spec reviewer) |
| `plan` | Spec → implementation plan with bite-sized TDD tasks |
| `build` | Plan execution — analyzes task graph, auto-selects parallel or serial |
| `team-dev` | Parallel agent execution with staggered quality gates (called by `build`) |
| `sdd` | Serial execution with two-stage review per task |
| `review` | Specialist swarm — dispatches parallel reviewers, scores findings |
| `pr-create` | PR creation with voice/tone standards and test plan |
| `pr-respond` | PR comment response — analyze, fix, commit, push, reply, resolve |
| `postmortem` | Post-merge retrospective with specialist/logic reviewer diagnosis |
| `debug` | Systematic debugging — root cause before fixes, always |
| `verify` | Evidence before assertions — run it before claiming it works |
| `tdd` | Red-green-refactor discipline |
| `finish` | Branch completion — merge, PR, keep, or discard |
| `extend` | Framework extension assistant — scaffolds new skills, specialists, packs |

### Core Agents (3)

| Agent | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `commit` | Conventional commits with hook awareness |
| `code-review` | Dispatches review swarm, delivers scored report |
| `pr-review` | Posts inline PR comments with suggestion blocks |

### Core Specialists (5)

`security`, `dead-code`, `error-handling`, `async-safety`, `performance` — language-agnostic code review specialists dispatched by `review`.

### Engineering Pack

`eng-copywriting` (sentence case standards), `eng-logging` (level guidance), `eng-testing` (test strategy), `test-coverage` (specialist).

## Self-Hosting Model

Jig eats its own dogfood. This repo installs itself as a plugin via `.claude/settings.json` — the same way any consumer project would. Skills, agents, and commands all come from the plugin. No symlinks, no special treatment.

When developing Jig, edit the source in `core/`. After pushing to GitHub, run `/plugin marketplace update duronext-jig` and `/reload-plugins` to see changes locally.

**When adding a new core skill:**
1. Create `core/skills/{name}/SKILL.md`
2. Add to the `skills` array in `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`
3. Add a command file in `commands/{name}.md` for `/jig:` namespace browsing

## Commands

| Task | Command |
|------|---------|
| List all skills | `find core/skills -name "SKILL.md" \| sort` |
| List specialists | `ls core/specialists/` |
| List agents | `ls core/agents/` |
| Verify plugin | `cat .claude/settings.json` |
| Check for stale refs | `grep -rn 'superpowers:' core/` (should return nothing) |
| Count lines | `find . -not -path './.git/*' -name '*.md' \| xargs wc -l \| tail -1` |

## Code Style

- Markdown: 80 char line width where practical
- YAML frontmatter: 2 space indent
- Skill names: lowercase with hyphens (`eng-` prefix for engineering pack, no prefix for core)
- Descriptions: MUST start with "Use when..."
- SKILL.md: under 500 lines. Heavy content goes in `reference/` subdirectory.
- No language-specific references in core skills (TypeScript, Python, etc.) — core is stack-agnostic

## Commit Conventions

- Conventional commits: `type(scope): message`
- Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `chore`, `refactor`, `test`
- Scopes: `core`, `framework`, `packs`, `adapters`, `scaffold`, `docs`, `agents`, `specialists`
- **Never commit or push without explicit user approval**
- Use the commit agent at `.claude/agents/commit.md`

## Contributing to Jig

### Modifying an existing skill
1. Edit the source at `core/skills/{name}/SKILL.md`
2. Validate: frontmatter has `name`, `description` (starts with "Use when..."), `tier`, `alwaysApply`
3. Check cross-references: `grep -rn '{skill-name}' core/` — update any references if you renamed or split
4. Verify no language-specific content leaked into core skills

### Adding a new core skill
1. Read `framework/SKILL_SCHEMA.md` for the frontmatter spec
2. Read `framework/TIER_SYSTEM.md` to choose the right tier
3. Create `core/skills/{name}/SKILL.md`
4. Create symlink: `ln -s ../../core/skills/{name} .claude/skills/{name}`
5. Add to the `skills` array in `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`
6. If the skill should surface during brainstorming, add it to the concerns checklist in `jig.config.md`

### How consumers install Jig
Teams add this to their project's `.claude/settings.json`:
```json
{
  "enabledPlugins": { "jig@duronext-jig": true },
  "extraKnownMarketplaces": {
    "duronext-jig": {
      "source": { "source": "github", "repo": "duronext/jig" }
    }
  }
}
```
This gives every teammate on the project the full Jig framework on clone — no manual marketplace add or plugin install needed.

### Adding a specialist
1. Create `core/specialists/{name}.md` with frontmatter: `name`, `description`, `model`, `tier`, `globs`, `severity`
2. The body below the frontmatter IS the specialist's prompt
3. `review` discovers it automatically — no config needed

### Key documents to read first
- `framework/GIT_HOST.md` — git host adapter (GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket command mapping)
- `framework/PIPELINE.md` — the 7-stage development pipeline
- `framework/DISCOVERY.md` — how Jig finds and loads skills
- `framework/SKILL_SCHEMA.md` — frontmatter spec for all skills
- `docs/specs/2026-03-28-jig-framework-design.md` — the original design spec

## Git Workflow

- Main branch: `main`
- Branch naming: `{username}/jig-{number}-{kebab-title}`
- **Never commit or push without explicit user approval**
