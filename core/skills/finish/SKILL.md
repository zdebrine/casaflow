# Finishing a Development Branch

**PURPOSE**: Guide the completion of development work through a structured decision flow: verify tests pass, present clear integration options, execute the chosen option, and clean up.

**GIT HOST**: PR creation in Option 2 uses GitHub (`gh`) as the default. If `git-host` in `casaflow.config.md` is not `github`, read `framework/GIT_HOST.md` for the platform-specific command equivalents.

**Core principle:** Verify tests -> Present options -> Execute choice -> Clean up.

**Announce at start:** "I'm using the finish skill to complete this work."

---

## When to Use

Invoke this skill when:
- Implementation is complete and all tasks are done
- `sdd` or `team-dev` reaches the end of execution
- The user says "we're done", "let's wrap up", "finish this branch", or "/finish"
- All planned tasks are implemented and tested

**Do NOT use when:**
- Tests are still failing (fix them first)
- Tasks remain in the implementation plan
- The review stage has not been completed

---

## The Process

### Step 1: Verify Tests

**Before presenting options, verify tests pass.**

Run the project's test suite:
```
<project-test-command>
```

**REQUIRED**: Use `verify` -- run the actual command, read the output, confirm zero failures before proceeding.

**If tests fail:**
```
Tests failing (N failures). Must fix before completing:

[Show failures]

Cannot proceed with merge/PR until tests pass.
```

Stop. Do not proceed to Step 2. Fix the failures first.

**If tests pass:** Continue to Step 2.

### Step 2: Determine Base Branch

Read `main-branch` from `casaflow.config.md` (default: `main`).

```bash
git merge-base HEAD <main-branch>
```

Or ask: "This branch split from `<main-branch>` -- is that correct?"

### Step 3: Present Options

Present exactly these 4 options:

```
Implementation complete. All tests pass. What would you like to do?

1. Merge back to <base-branch> locally
2. Push and create a Pull Request
3. Keep the branch as-is (I'll handle it later)
4. Discard this work

Which option?
```

**Do not add explanation** -- keep options concise. Wait for the user's choice.

### Step 4: Execute Choice

#### Option 1: Merge Locally

```bash
# Switch to base branch
git checkout <base-branch>

# Pull latest
git pull

# Merge feature branch
git merge <feature-branch>

# Verify tests on merged result
<test-command>

# If tests pass, delete the feature branch
git branch -d <feature-branch>
```

**If merge conflicts occur:**
- Show the conflicts to the user
- Ask how to resolve (do not auto-resolve)
- After resolution, run tests again before completing

**If tests fail after merge:**
- Report the failures
- Ask whether to abort the merge or fix forward

Then: Cleanup worktree (Step 5)

#### Option 2: Push and Create PR

```bash
# Push branch
git push -u origin <feature-branch>
```

Then create the PR. Read `casaflow.config.md` for:
- `require-ticket-reference` -- whether to include ticket reference
- `ticket-system` -- which system to reference
- `branching.format` -- to extract ticket number from branch name

```bash
# Create PR with structured description
gh pr create --title "<title>" --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## Summary
<2-3 bullets of what changed>

## Test Plan
- [ ] <verification steps>
EOF
)"
```

If the project has the `pr-create` skill, defer to it for PR creation.

Then: Cleanup worktree (Step 5)

#### Option 3: Keep As-Is

Report:
```
Keeping branch <name>. Worktree preserved at <path>.
```

**Do not clean up the worktree.**

#### Option 4: Discard

**Confirm first:**
```
This will permanently delete:
- Branch: <name>
- All commits: <commit-list>
- Worktree at <path> (if applicable)

Type 'discard' to confirm.
```

Wait for exact confirmation. Do not proceed without it.

If confirmed:
```bash
git checkout <base-branch>
git branch -D <feature-branch>
```

Then: Cleanup worktree (Step 5)

### Step 5: Cleanup Worktree

**For Options 1, 2, and 4:**

Check if working in a worktree:
```bash
git worktree list
```

If the current directory is a worktree (not the main working tree):
```bash
# Navigate out of the worktree first
cd <main-working-tree-path>

# Remove the worktree
git worktree remove <worktree-path>
```

If the project uses a worktree management command (check `casaflow.config.md` or project scripts), use that instead.

**For Option 3:** Keep the worktree intact.

## Quick Reference

| Option | Merge | Push | Keep Worktree | Cleanup Branch |
|--------|-------|------|---------------|----------------|
| 1. Merge locally | Yes | No | No | Yes (soft delete) |
| 2. Create PR | No | Yes | Yes (for PR updates) | No |
| 3. Keep as-is | No | No | Yes | No |
| 4. Discard | No | No | No | Yes (force delete) |

---

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Consequence | Fix |
|---------|------------|-----|
| Skipping test verification | Merge broken code, create failing PR | Always verify tests before offering options |
| Open-ended questions | "What should I do next?" is ambiguous | Present exactly 4 structured options |
| Automatic worktree cleanup | Remove worktree when user might need it | Only cleanup for Options 1 and 4 |
| No confirmation for discard | Accidentally delete work | Require typed "discard" confirmation |
| Merging without pulling latest | Merge conflicts discovered after merge | Always pull latest before merging |
| Not running tests after merge | Merge introduced regressions | Test the merged result before deleting branch |

---

## Red Flags

**Never:**
- Proceed with failing tests
- Merge without verifying tests on the merged result
- Delete work without typed confirmation
- Force-push without explicit user request
- Auto-select an option without asking the user
- Clean up worktree for Option 3 (keep as-is)

**Always:**
- Verify tests before offering options
- Present exactly 4 options
- Get typed confirmation for Option 4
- Run tests after merge (Option 1) before deleting the branch
- Check for worktree before cleanup

---

## Integration

**Called by:**
- `sdd` (terminal state) -- after all tasks complete and final review passes
- `team-dev` (terminal state) -- after all tasks complete and integration review passes

**Related skills:**
- `verify` -- used in Step 1 to verify tests pass
- `pr-create` -- can be used in Option 2 for more structured PR creation
- `review` -- should have been completed before reaching this skill

---

## Post-Completion

After the chosen option is executed and cleanup is done, suggest:

> "Work complete. If this was a feature or complex improvement, consider running `/postmortem` to capture lessons learned."

Do not auto-invoke the postmortem -- just suggest it.
