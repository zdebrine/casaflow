# PR Comment Responder

**PURPOSE**: Process reviewer feedback into fixes, replies, and resolved threads. Every unresolved PR comment thread should end this session resolved.

**GIT HOST**: Commands in this skill use GitHub (`gh`) as the default. If `git-host` in `casaflow.config.md` is not `github`, read `framework/GIT_HOST.md` for the platform-specific command equivalents.

---

## Mission

**Analyze. Fix. Commit. Push. Reply. Resolve.** That's the job.

```
FETCH unresolved comments + thread IDs
  |
ANALYZE each comment (valid fix? false positive? needs clarification?)
  |
For unclear ones --> ASK the user (this should be rare)
  |
IMPLEMENT code fixes for valid feedback
  |
BUILD + TEST to verify nothing broke
  |
COMMIT the fixes
  |
PUSH to remote
  |
REPLY to each comment on GitHub
  |
RESOLVE every addressed thread
```

**The pipeline is not optional.** Do not stop after implementing fixes. Do not stop after committing. The job is not done until replies are posted and threads are resolved on GitHub. A comment without a reply and resolution is unfinished work.

---

## Decision Rules

Most comments have obvious solutions. Act on them directly:

| Comment Type | Action |
|-------------|--------|
| Valid bug / missing guard | Fix it, reply with commit ref |
| Style / pattern suggestion | Fix it, reply confirming |
| False positive / intentional design | Reply explaining why, resolve |
| Question about approach | Reply with explanation, resolve |
| Genuinely ambiguous or risky | Ask user before acting (rare) |

**Default to action.** Only ask the user when the fix would be architecturally risky, when you genuinely do not understand the feedback, or when the commenter's suggestion conflicts with existing patterns.

---

## Prerequisites

GitHub CLI (`gh`) must be installed and authenticated. Verify with `gh auth status`.

---

## Step 1: Fetch PR Info + Unresolved Comments + Thread IDs

Run these in parallel. You need REST comment IDs (for replying) and GraphQL thread IDs (for resolving).

**Get PR info:**

```bash
gh pr view --json number,url,title,body
```

Extract owner/repo from `git remote get-url origin`. Use in all `gh api` calls below.

**Fetch PR comments (REST -- for replying):**

```bash
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{pr_number}/comments \
  --jq '.[] | {id: .id, path: .path, line: .line, body: .body, user: .user.login, created_at: .created_at}'
```

**Fetch unresolved thread IDs (GraphQL -- for resolving):**

The REST API gives you comment IDs (for replying), but resolving threads requires GraphQL thread IDs. Fetch both.

```bash
gh api graphql -f query='
{
  repository(owner: "OWNER", name: "REPO") {
    pullRequest(number: PR_NUM) {
      reviewThreads(first: 50) {
        nodes {
          id
          isResolved
          comments(first: 1) {
            nodes {
              databaseId
              body
              author { login }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}' --jq '.data.repository.pullRequest.reviewThreads.nodes[] | select(.isResolved == false) | {threadId: .id, commentId: .comments.nodes[0].databaseId, author: .comments.nodes[0].author.login, body: (.comments.nodes[0].body | split("\n")[0][:100])}'
```

**Mapping threads to comments:** The `commentId` from GraphQL matches the `id` from the REST comments endpoint. Use this to build a map of `commentId -> threadId` so you can resolve each thread after replying.

**Fetch a single comment's full body:**

The GraphQL query above truncates comment bodies to 100 chars. To get the full body of a specific comment:

```bash
# IMPORTANT: The path is /pulls/comments/{id} -- NOT /pulls/{pr_number}/comments/{id}
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/comments/{comment_id} \
  --jq '{id: .id, path: .path, line: .line, body: .body, user: .user.login}'
```

The single-comment endpoint drops the PR number from the path. Using `/pulls/{pr_number}/comments/{id}` will return a 404.

**If there are no unresolved comments, say so and stop.**

---

## Step 2: Analyze Each Comment

For each unresolved comment:

1. Read the referenced code files
2. Understand context deeply (do not skim)
3. Determine: valid fix, false positive, or needs clarification
4. If valid: plan the code change
5. If false positive: draft an explanation of why the current code is correct

### Bot Comment Validation

| Bot | Typical Comments | Validation Approach |
|-----|------------------|---------------------|
| `cursor[bot]` | Bug predictions, missing guards | ~50% false positive rate. Validate against actual code paths |
| `sentry[bot]` | Security concerns, bug predictions | Deep dive required. Often valid |
| `github-actions[bot]` | CI/CD status, test results | Check actual test failures |
| `dependabot[bot]` | Dependency updates | Review changelog and breaking changes |

**CRITICAL: Never trust a bot's factual claims. Always verify.**

Bots make assertions about code structure ("this entity doesn't have field X", "this method returns Y") that are frequently wrong. Before accepting ANY bot claim as valid:

1. **Verify every factual assertion independently.** If a bot says "Entity doesn't have a `name` column," READ the entity file and check.
2. **Read the actual source files** the bot references -- not just the diff lines.
3. **Check related files** that the bot may not have seen.
4. **Only after verification:** determine if the concern is valid or a false positive.
5. If valid: fix the issue and respond with what was fixed.
6. If false positive: respond explaining exactly what the bot got wrong and cite the evidence (file, line number).

**The cost of a false fix is higher than the cost of extra verification.** A wrong "fix" introduces a real bug where none existed.

### Human Comments (Usually Actionable)

| Pattern | Example | Response |
|---------|---------|----------|
| Style suggestion | "Use design tokens here" | Implement and confirm |
| Performance tip | "Consider memoizing this" | Implement and confirm |
| Question | "Is this intentional?" | Explain the reasoning |
| Bug report | "This will fail when..." | Fix and confirm |

---

## Step 3: Implement + Verify

For each valid fix:

1. **Edit** the code
2. **Build**: verify the project builds without errors
3. **Test**: run relevant tests -- must pass

---

## Step 4: Commit + Push

**Do both. Always.** A local commit without a push means the reply will reference a commit the reviewer cannot see.

```bash
# Commit the fixes (use commit agent)
# Then push immediately
git push
```

---

## Step 5: Reply + Resolve

For EACH addressed comment, do both. This is the finish line -- do not skip it.

**Reply to a comment:**

```bash
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{pr_number}/comments/{comment_id}/replies \
  -X POST \
  -f body='Your response message here'
```

**Important:**
- Use `-X POST` to specify POST method
- Use `-f body='...'` for the response body
- Use single quotes for the body to avoid escaping issues

**Resolve all addressed threads (AFTER replying):**

```bash
for thread_id in PRRT_abc123 PRRT_def456 PRRT_ghi789; do
  gh api graphql -f query="mutation { resolveReviewThread(input: {threadId: \"$thread_id\"}) { thread { isResolved } } }" --jq '.data.resolveReviewThread.thread.isResolved'
done
```

**Rules:**
- Always resolve AFTER replying (so the reply is visible before resolution)
- Only resolve threads you have actually addressed
- Do not resolve threads you deferred or where you disagreed without responding
- Threads already `isResolved: true` can be skipped

**Post top-level PR comment (optional):**

Use for summarizing multiple changes across many comments:

```bash
gh pr comment {pr_number} --body "### Summary of Changes

All feedback has been addressed:
- Updated design tokens
- Fixed the race condition
- Added error handling"
```

---

## Response Style

- Friendly, lowercase, concise
- Reference the commit hash when you fixed something
- Use code formatting for technical references
- Match the commenter's energy

### Good response examples

**Acknowledging a fix:**
> good call! updated to use the design token instead of the hardcoded value

**Explaining a decision:**
> thanks for flagging! looked into this -- the inner join is actually intentional here. this method only returns records that have the associated data. records without it have nothing to display or match against.

**Simple acknowledgment:**
> done!

**With commit reference:**
> fixed in abc1234. added the null check as suggested.

**Multi-point fix:**
> addressed both points:
> 1. added guard for self-reference prevention
> 2. wrapped empty state in droppable for drop zone coverage
> fixed in abc1234.

- [ ] Reply posted to every addressed comment
- [ ] Every addressed thread resolved via GraphQL
- [ ] No unresolved threads remaining (unless intentionally deferred)

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Not Found" (404) Errors
- **Fetching single comment**: Use `/pulls/comments/{id}` NOT `/pulls/{pr}/comments/{id}` -- the PR number is NOT in the path for single-comment lookups
- **Replying to comment**: Use `/pulls/{pr}/comments/{id}/replies` -- the PR number IS in the path for replies
- Ensure using `-X POST` for replies
- Verify comment ID exists

### Authentication Issues
```bash
gh auth login
gh auth status
```

### Rate Limiting
- GitHub API has rate limits
- Space out requests if posting many replies
- Check rate limit: `gh api rate_limit`
