# PR Postmortem

**PURPOSE**: After a PR merges, analyze what reviewers caught to find gaps in skills, specialists, and review checklists -- then fix those gaps. Every merged PR becomes training data for making the system better next time.

**GIT HOST**: Commands in this skill use GitHub (`gh`) as the default. If `git-host` in `casaflow.config.md` is not `github`, read `framework/GIT_HOST.md` for the platform-specific command equivalents.

**CONFIGURATION**: Reads `casaflow.config.md` for `ticket-system` (to offer ticket creation for improvements) and `main-branch`.

---

## When to Use

- A PR has been merged after receiving review feedback
- "Run a postmortem", "PR retro", "lessons learned from this PR"
- `kickoff` suggests this after the LEARN stage for features
- `/postmortem` invoked directly

**Do NOT use when:**
- The PR has not been merged yet (use `pr-respond` instead)
- The PR received no review comments (nothing to learn from)

---

## Workflow

```
Interview (detect PR from branch or ask)
  |
Fetch PR data (metadata, comments, reviews)
  |
Analyze comments (separate human from bot, focus on real fixes)
  |
Extract patterns (what was wrong, principle violated, how fixed)
  |
Cross-reference existing skills (is the pattern already documented?)
  |
Route: pattern violation --> Specialist Diagnosis
       correctness bug  --> Logic Reviewer Diagnosis
  |
Apply changes to skill files directly
  |
Report (patterns table, changes made, items needing judgment)
```

---

## Step 1: Interview

Detect the PR from the current branch, or ask.

```bash
# Try to find a merged PR for the current branch
gh pr list --head "$(git branch --show-current)" --state merged --json number,title --jq '.[0]'
```

If found, confirm: "Found PR #XXXX -- is that the one you want to audit?"

If not found, ask:

> Which PR would you like to run a postmortem on? Provide a PR number or URL.

---

## Step 2: Fetch PR Data

Run in parallel. Extract owner/repo from the git remote -- do not hardcode.

```bash
# PR metadata
gh pr view {number} --json title,body,state,mergedAt,headRefName,files

# All inline review comments (paginated)
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{number}/comments --paginate

# Review summaries
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{number}/reviews
```

---

## Step 3: Analyze Comments

**Filter:**
- Separate human reviewers from bots (cursor[bot], sentry[bot], dependabot[bot], github-actions[bot], and any other bot identifiers)
- Bot comments that led to real fixes count -- include them
- Bot comments dismissed as false positives -- skip them
- Focus on comments where the author responded with a fix ("good catch", "fixed in", "done")

**For each actionable comment, extract:**

| Field | Example |
|-------|---------|
| What was wrong | Hardcoded color value instead of theme token |
| Principle violated | Use design system tokens for all visual properties |
| How it was fixed | Replaced hex value with `token.colorPrimary` |
| Who caught it | reviewer-username (human) |

**Categorize into pattern groups** -- discover from the data, do not force into preset buckets. Common categories from past postmortems:

- Styling discipline (tokens, spacing, theming)
- Memoization / performance
- Translation completeness (including accessibility attributes)
- Type safety / enum handling
- State management / async safety
- Dead code / speculative code
- Accessibility affordances
- Frontend-backend contract mismatches
- Error handling gaps
- Security concerns

---

## Step 4: Cross-Reference Existing Skills

Scan the project's skills and specialists directories to find relevant files. For each pattern group:

1. Search `team/skills/`, `packs/*/skills/`, and `core/skills/` for related skills
2. Search `team/specialists/`, `packs/*/specialists/`, and `core/specialists/` for related specialists
3. Read the candidate skill(s) or specialist(s)
4. Check if the pattern is already documented
5. Classify:

| Classification | Meaning | Action |
|---------------|---------|--------|
| **Already covered** | Skill documents this but agent ignored it | Flag -- may need stronger wording or examples |
| **Gap** | Relevant skill exists but does not cover this pattern | Add to that skill |
| **No home** | No relevant skill covers this domain | Add to a specialist or project-level config |

---

## Step 5: Route the Finding

Before diving into diagnosis, determine which part of the review system should have caught the finding:

| Finding Type | Route to | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| **Pattern violation** | Swarm Specialist Diagnosis | Missing translations, raw throws, wrong imports, dead code, hardcoded tokens |
| **Correctness bug** | Logic Reviewer Diagnosis | Comparator mismatch, asymmetric paths, NULL handling, broken caller contract, state lifecycle |

**How to tell the difference:** Pattern findings can be caught by scanning the diff for a known anti-pattern. Correctness findings require *reasoning* -- tracing a value through function boundaries, checking if the inverse path handles the same cases, or reading files outside the diff to verify contracts.

---

## Swarm Specialist Diagnosis

When a missed finding should have been caught by the review swarm (`review`), walk through these failure modes in order to identify the root cause:

| # | Failure Mode | How to Diagnose | Fix |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | No specialist covers this concern | Search `specialists/*.md` in all three discovery directories -- none have this in "What to Check" | Create a new specialist file |
| 2 | Specialist exists but globs did not match | Check the specialist's `globs` against the file path that was missed | Update `globs` in frontmatter |
| 3 | Specialist ran but prompt did not cover this pattern | Read the specialist body -- the specific pattern is not mentioned | Add the pattern to the specialist's "What to Check" |
| 4 | Specialist ran, prompt covers it, model missed it | Pattern is documented but the model's capability is insufficient | Upgrade `model` in frontmatter (haiku -> sonnet -> opus) |
| 5 | Specialist ran, prompt covers it, model is capable | Prompt has too many concerns -- specialist needs splitting | Split into two specialist files |
| 6 | Specialist was skipped due to tier | Specialist is `full-only` but finding occurred during per-task review | Change `tier` to `fast-pass` in frontmatter |

**Always diagnose before adding.** If the specialist already covers the pattern (mode 4 or 5), adding more text to the prompt makes it worse, not better. Upgrade the model or split the specialist instead.

**Verification step**: After proposing a fix, check that it would have actually caught the finding:
- If adding globs, verify the missed file path matches the new pattern
- If upgrading the model, verify the concern requires reasoning the cheaper model cannot do
- If splitting, verify the new specialist's prompt is focused enough to catch it

---

## Logic Reviewer Diagnosis

When a missed finding is a correctness bug that the logic reviewer should have caught, walk through these failure modes:

| # | Failure Mode | How to Diagnose | Fix |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Logic reviewer did not run | Was this a per-task review (fast-pass tier)? Logic reviewer only runs pre-PR. | If this class of bug needs to be caught per-task, consider promoting to a specialist |
| 2 | No reasoning pattern covers this | Read the reasoning patterns in the logic reviewer -- does any pattern's trigger match? | Add a new reasoning pattern (or refine an existing pattern's trigger/procedure) |
| 3 | Pattern exists but trigger did not fire | The pattern's "When" section does not describe this code shape | Broaden the trigger -- add the missed code shape to the "When" list |
| 4 | Pattern triggered but procedure missed it | The "How" steps did not lead to discovering the bug | Add a step to the procedure, or add a "What breaks" example |
| 5 | Procedure would find it, but exploration did not reach the file | The logic reviewer reads callers/types proactively, but this file was not in scope | Add the file pattern to the proactive exploration directives |
| 6 | Everything was in place but the model did not connect the dots | The pattern, trigger, procedure, and files were all correct -- model just missed it | Add a concrete "What breaks" example matching this exact scenario |

**Key insight: The logic reviewer improves through examples, not rules.** Unlike specialists (which improve by adding checklist items), the logic reviewer improves by adding concrete "What breaks" examples under each reasoning pattern. When the model sees a specific past failure, it is far more likely to catch the next similar mistake than if you just add an abstract rule.

**How to add examples from postmortem findings:**

1. Identify which reasoning pattern should have caught it
2. Open the logic reviewer file (e.g., `core/skills/review/logic-reviewer.md`)
3. Under that pattern's "What breaks" section, add a one-line example:
   - `{description of what went wrong} ({PR number or brief context})`
4. Keep examples concrete and specific -- not abstract rules

**When to promote a logic finding to a specialist instead:**

If the same correctness bug appears 3+ times across different PRs, it has become a *pattern*, not a one-off logic issue. At that point:
- Create a new swarm specialist (or add to an existing one) that checks for this specific anti-pattern
- The specialist catches it cheaply and fast (haiku/sonnet) so the logic reviewer does not need to
- This is how the system self-optimizes: rare bugs start as logic reviewer catches, frequent bugs graduate to specialists

---

## Step 6: Prepare the Workspace

The PR is already merged. The user is likely still on the old branch.

```bash
# Stash any uncommitted work
git stash

# Get onto latest main
git checkout {main-branch} && git pull origin {main-branch}

# Create improvement branch
git checkout -b {username}/skill-improvements-from-pr-{number}
```

Read `main-branch` from `casaflow.config.md` (default: `main`).

If a ticket should be created for the improvements, offer to do so using the project's configured `ticket-system` from `casaflow.config.md`. Use title format: "Skill improvements -- lessons from PR #{number}".

---

## Step 7: Apply Changes

Edit skill and specialist files directly. Follow the existing style of each file:
- **Pitfalls** -> table rows (`| Problem | Solution |`)
- **Anti-patterns** -> code examples with clear good/bad markers
- **Checklists** -> bullet points with `-`
- **Reviewer prompts** -> question format (`- Pattern X present?`)

**Keep additions concise** -- 1-3 lines per pattern. A pitfall row is better than a paragraph.

**Files to check and update:**
- `team/skills/` -- team-specific skills that should cover the pattern
- `core/skills/` -- framework skills if no team skill covers the domain
- `team/specialists/` -- team-specific review specialists
- `core/specialists/` -- framework review specialists
- `core/skills/review/logic-reviewer.md` -- for "What breaks" examples
- `core/skills/review/tiers.md` -- should a specialist's tier or severity change?
- Project-level config (CLAUDE.md or equivalent) -- for project-wide rules

**Keeping reviewers in sync:** When adding a pattern to a skill, check whether it should also appear in any automated reviewer configurations the project uses. The skill is the authoritative source -- reviewer configs are concise summaries optimized for automated review context. Not every skill detail belongs in reviewer configs, but review-checkable rules (flag X, never do Y) should be represented.

---

## Step 8: Report and Hand Off

Present a structured summary:

```markdown
## PR Postmortem: PR #{number} -- "{title}"

### Comments Analyzed
- X comments from human reviewers
- Y comments from bots (Z actionable)
- N led to code changes

### Patterns Found

| Pattern | Count | Reviewer(s) | Skill | Status |
|---------|-------|-------------|-------|--------|
| Hardcoded tokens | 2 | reviewer-a | fe-styling | Gap -- added |
| Missing memoization | 1 | reviewer-b | fe-performance | Gap -- added |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

### Changes Made
- `team/skills/fe-styling/SKILL.md`: Added 2 anti-pattern examples
- `core/specialists/performance.md`: Added memoization check
- ...

### Items Needing Human Judgment
- [Anything ambiguous or subjective]
```

Then: "Ready to commit and push? Or want to review the diffs first?"

---

## Where to Put Guidance

When deciding where a pattern belongs, use the narrowest applicable scope:

| Scope | Location | Example |
|-------|----------|---------|
| One feature | Feature-tier skill | Negation logic in a specific filter system |
| One domain | Domain-tier skill | Objects inside memoization hooks |
| Cross-cutting | Specialist file | Dead code, async safety, security patterns |
| Reviewer gate | Review tiers config | Tier assignments, severity levels |
| Project-wide | Project config (CLAUDE.md or equivalent) | Never add indexes without asking |

**Avoid duplication.** A pattern belongs in ONE primary location (the skill or specialist). Automated reviewer configs are concise summaries -- not a second source of truth.

---

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Adding text to a specialist that already covers the pattern | Diagnose first. If the pattern is documented and the model missed it, upgrade the model or split -- do not add more text |
| Creating a specialist for a one-off issue | Start as a logic reviewer example. Only promote to specialist after 3+ occurrences |
| Skipping bot comments entirely | Bot comments that led to real fixes are valuable signal |
| Including dismissed false positives | Only analyze comments that resulted in actual code changes |
| Adding broad, abstract rules | Keep additions concrete. "Check comparators" is useless. "buildFilterValue produces `greaterThan` but handler only accepts `before`/`after`" is useful |
| Not verifying the fix would work | After proposing a change, check that the new globs match, the new prompt covers it, or the example is specific enough |
| Hardcoding ticket system references | Read `ticket-system` from `casaflow.config.md` -- offer to create tickets using the configured system |
| Forgetting to update automated reviewer configs | When adding a review-checkable rule to a skill, propagate to reviewer configs if applicable |
| Duplicating patterns across skills and specialists | One primary location per pattern. Other locations reference it, not repeat it |

---

## Integration

**Called by:**
- `kickoff` during the LEARN stage (post-merge)

**Related skills:**
- `review` -- the review swarm whose specialists this skill improves
- `pr-create` -- the PR whose comments this skill analyzes
- `pr-respond` -- for addressing feedback before the postmortem
- `extend` -- if the postmortem reveals the need for an entirely new skill or specialist

---

## Quick Reference

| Element | Rule |
|---------|------|
| Input | PR number or URL (auto-detect from branch) |
| Output | Edited skill/specialist files + structured report |
| Branch | `{username}/skill-improvements-from-pr-{number}` |
| Ticket | Optional -- offer to create via configured ticket system |
| Scope | Only patterns that led to real code changes -- skip noise |
| Style | Match the existing style of each skill/specialist file |
| Diagnosis | Always diagnose before adding. Specialists: 6 failure modes. Logic reviewer: 6 failure modes |
| Promotion | One-off correctness bugs start as logic reviewer examples. Patterns (3+ occurrences) graduate to specialists |
