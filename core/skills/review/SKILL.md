# Code Review Swarm Engine

**PURPOSE**: Dispatch parallel specialist review agents, each focused on one concern, to break the context ceiling that monolithic review prompts hit. The orchestrator coordinates dispatch, collects findings, scores mechanically, and produces a unified report.

**CONFIGURATION**: Reads `casaflow.config.md` for `swarm-tiers` (which specialists block vs advise), `deep-review-model`, and `specialist-model-default`.

---

## When to Use

- `code-review` agent invokes this with `tier: all` (pre-PR, full swarm)
- `team-dev` quality gate invokes this with `tier: fast-pass` (per-task, blocking checks only)
- Direct invocation via `/review` for manual reviews

**Logic reviewer** (pre-PR only): When invoked with `tier: all`, the orchestrator also dispatches a logic reviewer after the swarm specialists complete. The logic reviewer is skipped for `tier: fast-pass` invocations.

---

## Pipeline

### Stage 1: DISCOVER Specialists

Collect specialists from all three discovery directories (see `framework/DISCOVERY.md`):

1. Scan `team/specialists/`, `packs/*/specialists/`, and `core/specialists/` for `*.md` files
2. Read each file and parse the YAML frontmatter
3. Extract: `name`, `description`, `model`, `tier`, `globs`, `severity`
4. Deduplicate by `name` (team > pack > core)
5. Filter by the requested tier:
   - `tier: all` → include all specialists (both `fast-pass` and `full-only`)
   - `tier: fast-pass` → include only specialists where `tier: fast-pass`

Check `casaflow.config.md` for `swarm-tiers` to confirm which specialists are assigned to which tier.

### Stage 2: PREPARE the Diff

Obtain the diff based on the caller:

**From `code-review` agent (pre-PR):**
```bash
git fetch origin
git diff origin/{main-branch}...HEAD
git diff origin/{main-branch}...HEAD --name-only
```
Read `main-branch` from `casaflow.config.md` (default: `main`).

**From `team-dev` quality gate (per-task):**
```bash
git diff <BASE_SHA>..<HEAD_SHA>
git diff <BASE_SHA>..<HEAD_SHA> --name-only
```

Extract the list of changed file paths. For each specialist, intersect its `globs` array with the changed file paths. A specialist whose globs match zero changed files is **skipped** — log it as `skipped: no matching files` but do not spawn it.

For each matching specialist, extract only the diff hunks for its matched files. This is the **filtered diff** that the specialist will review.

### Stage 3: DISPATCH (Parallel)

For each specialist with matching files, spawn a parallel subagent using the Agent tool:

```
Agent tool:
  description: "Review: {specialist.name}"
  model: {specialist.model}     <- from frontmatter (haiku, sonnet, or opus)
  prompt: |
    {specialist body}           <- everything below the frontmatter in the specialist file

    ---

    ## Diff to Review

    {filtered diff}             <- only the files matching this specialist's globs
```

**All matching specialists are dispatched in a single message** (parallel Agent calls). Do not dispatch sequentially.

### Stage 4: COLLECT

Wait for all specialist subagents to complete. For each result:
- If the response is exactly `N/A` → record as N/A (ran but found nothing)
- Otherwise → parse the findings (File, Finding, Fix/Suggestion lines)

### Stage 5: DEEP REVIEW (pre-PR only)

**Skip this stage when `tier: fast-pass`.** The logic reviewer only runs for pre-PR reviews (`tier: all`).

After collecting swarm findings, dispatch the logic reviewer:

1. Read `logic-reviewer.md` from this skill's directory
2. Build the prompt:
   - The logic reviewer's body (everything below frontmatter)
   - The full diff (all changed files — NOT filtered by globs)
   - The swarm findings collected in Stage 4 (so it knows what's already caught)
3. Dispatch a single Agent with:
   - `model: opus` (or `deep-review-model` from `casaflow.config.md`)
   - Full tool access: Read, Grep, Glob, Agent (the logic reviewer explores the codebase and can spawn sub-agents)
4. Wait for the logic reviewer to complete
5. Parse findings in the same format as swarm specialists

### Stage 6: SCORE

Apply mechanical scoring based on the highest severity finding. All findings are always reported regardless of score.

| When this is the highest severity | Score cannot be higher than |
|-----------------------------------|----------------------------|
| `blocking` | 4 |
| `major` (no blocking) | 7 |
| `minor` only | 8-9 |
| No findings | 10 |

No exceptions, no bumps for positives.

Deduplication:
- If multiple specialists flag the same `file:line` → merge into one finding, use the higher severity, note all specialists
- If the logic reviewer flags the same `file:line` as a specialist → drop the logic reviewer's finding (specialist caught it first)
- If the logic reviewer flags a different `file:line` but same root cause as a specialist → keep both, note the connection

### Stage 7: REPORT

Produce the unified report in this exact format:

## Code Review Summary

**Confidence Score**: X/10
**Risk Level**: Low/Medium/High
**Specialists**: N dispatched, M skipped, K N/A
**Logic reviewer**: {ran / skipped (fast-pass)}

### Blocking Issues
{if any — grouped by specialist}

#### [{specialist.name}] {title}
- **File**: path:line_number
- **Finding**: {description}
- **Fix**: {actionable suggestion}

### Major Issues
{if any — same format}

### Minor Suggestions
{if any — same format, using "Suggestion" instead of "Fix"}

### Logic Review Findings
{if logic reviewer ran — findings grouped by severity, using the [logic] prefix}

#### [logic] {title}
- **File**: path:line_number
- **Finding**: {description}
- **How found**: {reasoning pattern and trace}
- **Fix**:
  ```
  {code suggestion}
  ```
- **Verify**: {how to confirm}

### Specialist Summary

| Specialist | Status | Findings |
|---|---|---|
| {name} | {N blocking / N major / N minor / clean / N/A / skipped} | {one-line summary or —} |
| logic-reviewer | {N blocking / N major / N minor / clean / skipped} | {one-line summary or —} |

**Skipped vs N/A distinction:**
- **Skipped** = specialist's globs matched zero changed files (never spawned)
- **N/A** = specialist ran but found nothing relevant in the diff
- **Clean** = specialist ran, found relevant code, but no issues

## Tier Reference

See `tiers.md` for tier definitions, severity levels, and the default specialist inventory.

---

## Adding a New Specialist

1. Create a new `.md` file in `team/specialists/` (for team-specific) or `core/specialists/` (for framework)
2. Add frontmatter: `name`, `description`, `model`, `tier`, `globs`, `severity`
3. Write the review prompt body with: What to check, What to ignore, Report format
4. The orchestrator discovers it automatically on next run — no config updates needed

## Splitting a Specialist

When a specialist's prompt grows too large:

1. Identify which concerns to split out
2. Create a new specialist file with the extracted concerns
3. Remove those concerns from the original specialist
4. Both specialists keep the same globs (they review the same files for different things)

## Integration Notes

### With `code-review` agent
The agent fetches `git diff origin/{main-branch}...HEAD`, then follows this skill's pipeline with `tier: all`.

### With `team-dev`
The lead dispatches this skill as a subagent after spec compliance passes. Diff is scoped to the task's commits (BASE_SHA..HEAD_SHA). Uses `tier: fast-pass`.

### With `postmortem`
When a finding is missed, the postmortem uses the Specialist Summary table to diagnose which specialist should have caught it.
